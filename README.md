Practicing SQL coding questions

[](https://ibb.co/nQL11Kd)

In this repository I'll be posting my solutions to the SQL questions from [SQLPad](https://sqlpad.io/).
The database schema can be found here - [SQL Playground](https://sqlpad.io/sql-playground/)

If you are starting with SQL and you would like a course recommendation, I would suggest:  
+ [Master SQL For Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-sql-for-data-science/) created by Imtiaz Ahmad.
